# bash-scripts-world
List of real-world bash scripts.

I will be dividing the scripts (as much as possible) in the following 3 levels:
  - Beginners
  - Intermediate
  - Advance

As this project grows, I will be adding "specific use-case scenarios", for example "monitoring scripts".

Cheers!
Daniel
